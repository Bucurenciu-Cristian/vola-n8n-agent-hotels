So, yes. The booking review scrapper worked, but not at all in great shape.

Basically, your work for 


TASK

I want to trigger multiple api google maps requests in phase no.2 (when you're going after reviews from airbnb and booking) based on the full address that is present in the booking response. like in @big_booking.json which is under the address.full property. 

Basically I think you should fetch info specific via n8n-mcp to understand how to actually make requests in parallel, not just one. Use the same format as the other 2 reviews scrappers. (the input, I mean)
