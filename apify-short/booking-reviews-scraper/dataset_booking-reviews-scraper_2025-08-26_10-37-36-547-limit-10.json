We are sorry to hear that your stay did not meet your expectations, particularly with regard to the size of the room, ventilation and brightness.\n\nOur rooms are designed to offer a functional and comfortable space, but we understand that this may seem cramped to some. Regarding the windows, some rooms do indeed have windows that do not open, for safety reasons or due to the building's configuration, but we also have other options available on request, subject to availability.\n\nWe also take note of your comments about the smell and ventilation, and have already passed this on to our technical team for a thorough check. Finally, our city centre location may indeed mean narrower streets, but it also allows quick access to the main sites of interest.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact reception upon arrival so that we can find a suitable solution.\n\nWe hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back, in a room that better meets your expectations.\n\nKind regards,\n\nRémi",
